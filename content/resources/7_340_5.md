description: This resource contains lecture notes on the classical pathway of endogenous
  antigen presentation, how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can trigger down-regulation

  product was found to target MHC class I for degradation in the cytosol, and the
  cellular machinery used by the virus to reach its goal.
